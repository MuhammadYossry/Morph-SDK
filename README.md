#Morph-SDK

************************

This project provides a 3D virtual applications software development kit, which has a 3D interface editor which allows users to manage their 3D scene and create their 3D application, and a base framework that the editor relies on.

##System Features

- User friendly, you can create a whole interactive 3D scene.
- Loading Ogre scene (.scene) contents (including meshes, animations, textures, ...etc) within scene tree hierarchy names.
- Real-time scene preview, navigation and manipulation (deleting objects, moving, rotating, scaling). 
- Visual Editor with command patten, undo/redo support, unicode support, Qt based user interface, object hierarchy system, property system. 
- Provide API classes to develop event-driven finite-state machine to define behavior for scene objects.
- Provide graphical tools for behavioral/logic editing, ex. automatically generate code equivalent to what user express in graphical tools. 
- Give ability to extend with code.
- Provide predefined widgets (buttons, sliders, knobs) to utilize with 3D objects.
- Provide integration with input/output devices. Make it ready to use with framework.
- Provide simple UI to link input events to output callbacks.
- Generate stand-alone 3D/VR applications.
